# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods? 6/10
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own? 6/10
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!) can we write any methods we want as long as it makes sense?
